# About Me 

I am a PhD student at Arizona State University, advised by [Hannah Kerner](https://hannah-rae.github.io/), with a research focus on Machine Learning for Remote Sensing [GeoFoundation Models, Cropland mapping]. During Fall 2024, I interned at Google X, the Moonshot Factory, where I worked on representation learning with multispectral and hyperspectral data. Previously, I was part of the Geospatial team at the Rwanda Space Agency (RSA), where I contributed to the development of machine learning systems leveraging satellite imagery for real-world applications.

Prior to RSA, I was a machine learning research engineer at [INRIA Grenoble](9https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-centre-university-grenoble-alpes) where my research focused on hyperspectral unmixing and sparse coding. I have a masters in Machine Intelligence from [AMMI](https://aimsammi.org/about-ammi-2/) where I worked with [Georgia Gkioxari](https://gkioxari.github.io/) on deep compression for edge computing and their application in conservation of the environment.<br>
