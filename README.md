# About Me 

I am a PhD student at Arizona State University advised by [Hannah Kerner](https://hannah-rae.github.io/) focusing on Machine Learning for Remote Sensing. I am part of the Rwanda Space Agency (RSA) Geospatial team, where I contribute on the development of machine learning systems that leverage satellite imagery for real-world applications.

Prior to RSA, I was a machine learning research engineer at [INRIA Grenoble](9https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-centre-university-grenoble-alpes) where my research focused on hyperspectral unmixing and sparse coding. I have a masters in Machine Intelligence from [AMMI](https://aimsammi.org/about-ammi-2/) where I worked with [Georgia Gkioxari](https://gkioxari.github.io/) on deep compression for edge computing and their application in conservation of the environment.<br>

With our approach we are able to compress a state-of-the-art object detection model by 30.0% without a loss in performance. We also show that our compressed model can be easily initialized with existing pre-trained weights, and thus is able to fully utilize published state-of-the-art model zoos. /<a href="https://github.com/Gedeon-m-gedus/compressed_object_detection">Github</a> /<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02896"> arXiv</a> /
